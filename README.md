# gaussianblur
1. Sample pictures should be in the same directory as the source code files.
2. Blur radius is set at 8 so blur effect will differ according to resolution(Some won't be as blur as the others).
3. The program will generate folders for output(SOutput for sequential code and POutput for Parallel code).
